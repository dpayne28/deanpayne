            <h3>About Me:</h3>
          </div>

          <div class="sectionContent">
            <p>I was born in Pietermeritzburg, South Africa and migrated to Western Australia in 2008 with my family. I graduated from Lesmurdie Senior High School in 2014 and after moving from job to job trying to find something that could keep me
              both engaged interested I finally landed a job for a small IT company, thus began my career into information technology.
              I thoroughly enjoy outdoor activities, am part of a regular social basketball team, amateur football (soccer, the real football) squad and fill in for a mixed netball team. I have two dogs, Nico (Border Collie x Husky) and Oscar (Border
              Collie)
              When I do find myself with free time, I indulge in PC games with my friends, League of Legends, Apex Legends and I am currently trying to complete Sifu which I am enjoying but finding extremely difficult because of my play style. We
              have also recently gotten really into board and card games Bang, Dominion and Coup to name a few.</p>
