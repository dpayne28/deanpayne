    My name is Dean Payne, I was born in Pietermeritzburg Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa.
    I graduated from Lesmurdie Senior High School in 2014 and began my career as a Systems Engineer.
    I enjoy outdoor activities, am part of a regular social basketball team, amateur football (soccer, the real football) squad and fill in for a mixed netball team.
    I have two dogs, Nico (Border Collie x Husky) and Oscar (border Collie)
    When I do find myself with free time, I do indulge in PC games with my friends, League of legends, Apex Legends and I am currently trying to complete Sifu which I am thoroughly enjoying but finding extremely difficult because of my play style. We have also recently gotten really into board and card games some being Bang, Dominion and Coup.
