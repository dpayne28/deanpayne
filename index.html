            <article>
              <p>I was born in Pietermeritzburg, South Africa and migrated to Western Australia in 2008 with my family. I graduated from Lesmurdie Senior High School in 2014 and after moving from job to job trying to find something that could keep me both engaged interested I finally landed a job for a small IT company, thus began my career into information technology.
I thoroughly enjoy outdoor activities, am part of a regular social basketball team, amateur football (soccer, the real football) squad and fill in for a mixed netball team. I have two dogs, Nico (Border Collie x Husky) and Oscar (border Collie)
When I do find myself with free time, I indulge in PC games with my friends, League of legends, Apex Legends and I am currently trying to complete Sifu which I am enjoying but finding extremely difficult because of my play style. We have also recently gotten really into board and card games some being Bang, Dominion and Coup.</p>
